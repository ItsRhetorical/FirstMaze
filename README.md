# FirstMaze
Simple maze solving program to learn python

Run maze Solver.py to get started

Note currently only one entrance is supported (on the top row) and one exit (on the bottom row)
Side openings are technically not supported
brute forcing whitespace works, but takes forever to animate I recommend keeping all paths to 1 wide until optimized
cannot travel diagonally
